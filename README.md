# Update
### I am going to make this app again. It was built on US server by mistake and thus has a lot of latency (can't scale for different regions üßî)

***

Secure, cross platform messaging app made using React-native, AWS. This app acts as an introduction to secure communication services using encryption of network instead of the message.

‚ö†Ô∏è : **In the current version, this app's messages can be read by the backend developer, as all messages are currently visible in the AWS Amplify Console. Do NOT send any confidential message.**

The application offers various features like: 
* custom authentication screens, developed utilizing AUTH token from AWS;
* password recovery using OTP;
* email verification of users on sign-up;
* real time messaging;
* real time message read reciepts;
* last seen of users;
* ability to create groups;
* more to be listed soon...
